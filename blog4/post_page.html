							<p>There are some artists who do it for the money, and some artists who do it for the fame. The best artists are independent of the above, and they do it because art is what makes them live and breathe. This could be a great topic for a classification essay - one that sorts ideas, objects, and people into particular classes or groups.</p>
							<p>After picking your topic, it is necessary to decide on the classification criteria to give your essay structure. Following these established criteria for every class or group will provide a smooth reading experience for your reader.</p>
							<p>Consider implementing the following patterns to make your classification process more effective:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Sort things into categories by their usefulness;</li>
								<li>Make sure to use the same sorting technique for each category;</li>
								<li>Provide examples that can fall into each category.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 class="article_body_subtitle">Looking For Categories</h3>
							<p>After making a list of subjects that piqued your interest, take note of how you can categorize each subject. The best way is identifying different categories under which things fall.</p>
							<p>For example, you are at a sports game, and you choose to inspect the various types of sports fans. Right away you’ll see the active viewers- passionate fans with face paint in the front rows who know every player, the aspiring young sportsmen, money-motivated people who bet on their teams, and the loud and aggressive hooligans. Upon taking a closer look, you’ll see the more passive viewers- families taking their kids for an experience or people who were dragged along to the game by their friends. All of these are sorting categories which you will use if you write a classification essay about the various types of sports fans.</p>
							<p>Now that we're done with categorization, it’s crucially important to tell you more about.</p>
							<h3 class="article_body_subtitle">Crafting A Thesis Statement</h3>
							<p>The thesis statement should be at the end of the paper introduction. It must concisely present the main goal of your topic and show the classification criteria you’re going to use.</p>
							<p>Here is an example of a short paper introduction containing a thesis statement at the end:</p>
							<p>Example: It’s a warm August morning in Rome. Tourists from all over the world leave their hotels to start a day-long walk through the Eternal City’s numerous iconic sights. These tourists have different motivations, experiences, and personal goals for their visit to Rome. Nevertheless, they are all equally bound to visit the following sites: Vatican City, The Pantheon, and the Colosseum.</p>
							<h3 class="article_body_subtitle">How To Write An Outstanding Classification Essay</h3>
							<p>Below are some tips on how to make your paper a true masterpiece.</p>
							<h3 class="article_body_subtitle">Have a clear vision</h3>
							<p>For example, once you have talked about Rome’s top attractions, it doesn’t mean that you should exclude the Trevi Fountain, another one of Rome’s highly visited sites. Without mentioning it, your story is going to be incomplete. On the other hand, it doesn’t mean that you should have a list of places (in our case top sights) that relate to each other.</p>
